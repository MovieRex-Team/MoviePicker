Hey everyone! 
My name is Cris, attending my final year at WCC, might transfer to Eastern Michigan if possible. Outside of class, I work in contracting and do a set of home improvement jobs. On my freetime, I enjoy listening to music, watching shows/movies, gamimg, writing, play guitar, and riding my stakeborad. I'm exicted to work on this project with you guys!
