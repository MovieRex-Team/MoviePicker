My name is Jire, and this is my last semester in WCC's C++ program. After finishing school I hope to move to Virginia to start my career. Outside of school, a lot of my time still goes to programming, where, in personal projects, I mostly program in nodejs, but have a bit of experience in html/css and c#. I also enjoy video games, playing frisbee, and biking.
