Hi I'm Greg, I'm in the Java program here at WCC and am 3 classes away from graduating. I currently work as an Application Analyst for a small startup and help an old restaurant I used to work at on Sundays. I love working on web technologies, so I'm excitd to work on the website with everyone. Some things I like to do in my spare time are bike riding, watching TV, and hanging out with friends or family.
