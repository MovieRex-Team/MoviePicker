2.2 Product Functions 

- Movie recommendation based off multiple user interests and history, along with movie data from the internet, presented in a streamline fashion. Based off analysis of user trends, we present options from our machine learning algorithm that best suits the interest of the user. The user must then choose from a few options(A “seen it” button, “Didn’t like it” button, or “I enjoyed it” button) and based on the option selected, the algorithm start again.
